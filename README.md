## Diabetes Prediction
> Predict Diabetes using Machine Learning.


In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like *Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure,Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function and Age*. We will perform all the steps from *Data gathering to Model deployment.* Then we create a web app using Flask which is a python micro framework.
